# ⚠️ CRITICAL: MANUAL DOWNLOAD REQUIRED

The automated download tools are being blocked or redirected (downloading 0MB files). You MUST download Boost manually.

## 1. Download Instructions
1. Open this link in your browser:
   👉 **[Download Boost 1.72.0 (SourceForge)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.72.0/boost_1_72_0.zip/download)**

2. Wait for the download to start (it's about **160 MB**).

3. Once downloaded, move the `boost_1_72_0.zip` file to this folder:
   `D:\Slamalyzer-Project\ORB_SLAM3_AR-for-Android\temp_downloads\`

## 2. After Downloading
Run this command in the terminal:

```powershell
.\install_boost_manual.ps1
```

(I have created this script for you below)
